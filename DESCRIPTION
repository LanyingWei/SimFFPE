Description: The NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing) reads from FFPE 
    (Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded) samples contain numerous artifact 
    chimeric reads (ACRS), which can lead to false positive structural variant 
    calls. These ACRs are derived from the combination of two single-stranded 
    DNA (ss-DNA) fragments with short reverse complementary regions (SRCRs). 
    This package simulates these artifact chimeric reads as well as normal reads 
    for FFPE samples on the whole genome / several chromosomes / large regions.
